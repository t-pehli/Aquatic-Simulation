# Aquatic-Simulation
Create and manage a small aquatic environment, complete with shrimps, plankton, sharks and oilspills.

This simulation was developed as a proof-of-concept educational project with C++ during university studies.

Currently, the only output is in the form of command line menus, although all information is included and many options are available.
The enviroment consists of planktonic and non-planktonic organisms, namely Phytoplankton, Zooplankton from the former category and Shrimps, Sardines, Mullets, Octopi, Tunas, Turtles, Dolphins and Sharks from the latter.
There is a food chain where certain species can eat certain others, and organisms move, grow, find food and mate in the simulated environment. Furthermore, there are three simulated events available to the user, namely a harpoon strike, a fishnet throw and a lingering oilspill.
Simulation settings, organism/species info and event triggering can be accessed through the simulation pause menu ('P' or 'Esc').

This project is discontinued, although it would be greatly improved with the addition of a realtime map view.
